## Setup üë∑

### Extract your Facebook data üì¶

Create a new empty directory somewhere sensible on your machine. This will contain your Facebook data.

Alternatively, you can [download the project files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives#downloading-source-code-archives) from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mitchealex1/all-about-yourself). Once this is downloaded, extract the zip file into a sensible directory.
